| 1 | from qiskit import execute | e634 | Qiskit’s execute() function is deprecated. This function served as a high-level wrapper around transpiling a circuit with some transpile options and running it on a backend with some run options. To do the same thing, you can explicitly use the transpile() function (with appropriate transpile options) followed by backend.run() (with appropriate run options). | qiskit.execute | from qiskit import transpile |
