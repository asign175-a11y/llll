| 1 | from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, Aer, execute | 1b49 | Importing from qiskit.providers.aer is deprecated and will stop working in Qiskit 1.0. You should instead import from qiskit_aer, which is a drop-in replacement. | qiskit.providers.aer | from qiskit_aer import Aer |
| 7 | qasm_str = qc.qasm() | 03c2 | The QuantumCircuit.qasm() method used to generate a OpenQASM 2 representation of the QuantumCircuit object has been deprecated and will be removed in the Qiskit 1.0.0 release. The qasm2.dump() or qasm2.dumps() functions which provide similar functionality should be used instead. | QuantumCircuit.qasm() | qasm2.dumps(qc) |
| 9 | qasm_qc = qasm.Qasm(data=qasm_str) | 25fc | The qiskit.converters.ast_to_dag function has been deprecated and will be removed in the Qiskit 1.0.0 release. It previously was used to convert the abstract syntax tree generated by the legacy OpenQASM 2 parser (in the qiskit.qasm module which has been deprecated) and convert that directly to a DAGCircuit. As the legacy OpenQASM 2 parser has been deprecated this function will no longer serves a purpose after the legacy parser is removed. If you were previously using this, you can instead parse your OpenQASM 2 files into a QuantumCircuit using the QuantumCircuit.from_qasm_file() or QuantumCircuit.from_qasm_str() constructor methods and then converting that QuantumCircuit into a DAGCircuit with circuit_to_dag(). | qiskit.qasm.Qasm | QuantumCircuit.from_qasm_str(qasm_str) |
| 12 | simulator = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator') | 1b49 | Importing from qiskit.providers.aer is deprecated and will stop working in Qiskit 1.0. You should instead import from qiskit_aer, which is a drop-in replacement. | Aer.get_backend | from qiskit_aer import Aer; simulator = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator') |
