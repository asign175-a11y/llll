| 3 | from qiskit.tools.visualization import plot_histogram | 2354 | The qiskit.tools.visualization module has been deprecated and will be removed in Qiskit 1.0.0. This module was a legacy redirect from the original location of Qiskit’s visualization module and was moved to qiskit.visualization in Qiskit 0.8.0. If you’re still using this path you can just update your imports from qiskit.tools.visualization to qiskit.visualization. | qiskit.tools.visualization | from qiskit.visualization import plot_histogram |
| 24 | plot_histogram(counts) | 1b33 | Passing a QuasiDistribution, ProbDistribution, or a distribution dictionary in for the data argument of the plot_histogram() visualization function is now deprecated. Support for doing this will be removed in the Qiskit 1.0 release. If you would like to plot a histogram from a QuasiDistribution, ProbDistribution, or a distribution dictionary you should use the plot_distribution() function instead. | plot_histogram(counts) | plot_distribution(counts) |
