| 8 | from qiskit import Aer | 1b33 | Use of the qiskit.Aer object is deprecated and will be removed in Qiskit 1.0. You should instead use the same object from the qiskit_aer namespace, which is a drop-in replacement. | qiskit.Aer | from qiskit_aer import Aer |
| 11 | from qiskit import execute | e634 | Qiskit’s execute() function is deprecated. This function served as a high-level wrapper around transpiling a circuit with some transpile options and running it on a backend with some run options. To do the same thing, you can explicitly use the transpile() function (with appropriate transpile options) followed by backend.run() (with appropriate run options). Alternatively, the Sampler primitive is semantically equivalent to the deprecated execute() function. The class BackendSampler is a generic wrapper for backends that do not support primitives. | qiskit.execute | from qiskit import transpile |

| 14 | from qiskit.tools.visualization import plot_histogram | 2354 | The qiskit.tools.visualization module has been deprecated and will be removed in Qiskit 1.0.0. This module was a legacy redirect from the original location of Qiskit’s visualization module and was moved to qiskit.visualization in Qiskit 0.8.0. If you’re still using this path you can just update your imports from qiskit.tools.visualization to qiskit.visualization. | qiskit.tools.visualization.plot_histogram | from qiskit.visualization import plot_histogram |
