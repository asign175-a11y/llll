| 1 | from qiskit.qasm import Qasm | fc96 | If your project depends on Qiskit, it may rely on functionality that will no longer be supported in Qiskit 1.0.0. For this reason, we recommend that you proactively cap your supported version to <1.0. Qiskit 1.0.0 is scheduled to release approximately two weeks after Qiskit 0.46.0, on 2024-02-15, and might not yet be available when you read this message. | Qiskit 1.0.0 compatibility | No direct refactoring provided, but implies update/version capping |
| 1 | from qiskit.qasm import Qasm | a7ac | If import qiskit raises an ImportError for you, your environment is in an invalid state, and versions of Qiskit 0.45/0.46 and 1.0 are both reachable, which will result in subtly broken code. You will need to create a new virtual environment, and ensure that only one of the two versions are installed. In particular, if you are intending to install Qiskit 1.0, you must have no packages that depend on qiskit-terra installed; these packages are incompatible with Qiskit 1.0 and must be updated. If you are intending to install Qiskit 0.45 or 0.46, you must ensure that you have nothing attempting to install qiskit>=1.0. | Qiskit 1.0.0 installation conflict | Create new virtual environment for Qiskit >= 1.0.0 |
| 1 | from qiskit.qasm import Qasm | 6835 | The 0.46.0 release is the final minor version release for the 0.x series. This release primarily adds new deprecation warnings for API changes coming in the future major version release 1.0.0. It is fully compatible with the Qiskit 0.45.x releases. It is strongly recommended that you upgrade from 0.45.x to 0.46.0 so that you’re able to see the warnings about which interfaces will change with Qiskit 1.0.0. | Qiskit 0.x series end-of-life | Upgrade to 0.46.0 to see deprecation warnings for 1.0.0 changes |
| 1 | from qiskit.qasm import Qasm | f885 | If you develop a library based on Qiskit and you still have a dependency on qiskit-terra, you should urgently release a new package that depends only on qiskit. Since version 0.44, the qiskit package contained only the qiskit-terra compiler core (the component that is now simply called “Qiskit”), so if your minimum version is 0.44, you can safely switch a qiskit-terra>=0.44 dependency to qiskit>=0.44 with no change in what will be installed. For more detail and recommendations for testing and preparation, see the section for developers of the migration guide. | qiskit-terra dependency | Switch qiskit-terra>=0.44 to qiskit>=0.44 |
| 1 | from qiskit.qasm import Qasm | b185 | The qiskit.providers.basicaer module and all of its classes are deprecated from Qiskit 0.46 onwards. Their use should be replaced with the qiskit.quantum_info module and the new qiskit.providers.basic_provider module. | qiskit.providers.basicaer | Replace with qiskit.quantum_info and qiskit.providers.basic_provider |
| 1 | from qiskit.qasm import Qasm | b0ee | The qiskit.providers.fake_provider module has been migrated to the qiskit-ibm-runtime Python package. For this reason, the following elements in the qiskit.providers.fake_provider have been deprecated as of Qiskit 0.46 and will be removed in Qiskit 1.0: | qiskit.providers.fake_provider | Replace with qiskit_ibm_runtime.fake_provider |
| 1 | from qiskit.qasm import Qasm | 7a1f | The qiskit.tools module has been deprecated and will be removed in Qiskit 1.0.0. Except as noted in the release notes above for specific submodules (qiskit.tools.jupyter, qiskit.tools.monitor, qiskit.tools.events and qiskit.tools.visualization) the functionality in this module have been migrated to qiskit.utils. If you’re using any functionality in this module you can update your imports from qiskit.tools to qiskit.utils. | qiskit.tools module | Update imports from qiskit.tools to qiskit.utils |
| 1 | from qiskit.qasm import Qasm | 1b33 | Use of the qiskit.Aer object is deprecated and will be removed in Qiskit 1.0. You should instead use the same object from the qiskit_aer namespace, which is a drop-in replacement. | qiskit.Aer object | Use qiskit_aer namespace |
| 1 | from qiskit.qasm import Qasm | 8c20 | When updating Qiskit from 0.46.x to 1.0.0 you will not be able to update in place. For example, pip install -U qiskit or pip install --upgrade qiskit is not supported and likely will not work. To upgrade qiskit the recommended path is to create a new virtual environment (venv) to build a new separate environment for Qiskit>=1.0.0. | Qiskit 0.46.x to 1.0.0 upgrade | Create a new virtual environment for Qiskit >= 1.0.0 |
| 1 | from qiskit.qasm import Qasm | 2354 | The qiskit.tools.events module and the progressbar() utility it exposed has been deprecated and will be removed in the Qiskit 1.0.0 release. This module’s functionality was not widely used and better covered by dedicated packages such as tqdm. | qiskit.tools.events module | Replace with dedicated packages like tqdm |

| 4 | circuit2 = Qasm(filename=qasm_file) | a747 | The qiskit.extensions module is now deprecated. It had been pending deprecation since the Qiskit 0.45 release. Most objects have been moved to qiskit.circuit.library, including: DiagonalGate, HamiltonianGateGate, Initialize, Isometry, MCGupDiag, UCGate, UCPauliRotGate, UCRXGate, UCRYGate, UCRZGate, UnitaryGate. With the deprecation of the objects, the following circuit methods have also been deprecated: QuantumCircuit.diagonal, QuantumCircuit.hamiltonian, QuantumCircuit.isometry and QuantumCircuit.iso, QuantumCircuit.uc, QuantumCircuit.ucrx, | qiskit.extensions module | Move to qiskit.circuit.library |
| 4 | circuit2 = Qasm(filename=qasm_file) | 5fc9 | The qiskit.converters.ast_to_dag function has been deprecated and will be removed in the Qiskit 1.0.0 release. It previously was used to convert the abstract syntax tree generated by the legacy OpenQASM 2 parser (in the qiskit.qasm module which has been deprecated) and convert that directly to a DAGCircuit. As the legacy OpenQASM 2 parser has been deprecated this function will no longer serves a purpose after the legacy parser is removed. If you were previously using this, you can instead parse your OpenQASM 2 files into a QuantumCircuit using the QuantumCircuit.from_qasm_file() or QuantumCircuit.from_qasm_str() constructor methods and then converting that QuantumCircuit into a DAGCircuit with circuit_to_dag(). | qiskit.converters.ast_to_dag function | Use QuantumCircuit.from_qasm_file() or QuantumCircuit.from_qasm_str() then circuit_to_dag() |

| 4 | circuit2 = Qasm(filename=qasm_file) | 03c2 | The QuantumCircuit.qasm() method used to generate a OpenQASM 2 representation of the QuantumCircuit object has been deprecated and will be removed in the Qiskit 1.0.0 release. The qasm2.dump() or qasm2.dumps() functions which provide similar functionality should be used instead. If you were using the QuantumCircuit.qasm() method to generate pygments formatted output you should instead look at the standalone openqasm-pygments package to provide this functionality (as qasm2.dump() and qasm2.dumps() do not provide pygments colored output). | QuantumCircuit.qasm() method | Use qasm2.dump() or qasm2.dumps() |
