| 2 | from qiskit.test.mock import FakeVigo | 7a1f | The `qiskit.test` module is deprecated. This module contains tooling and helpers for internal Qiskit testing, and most of its functionality had been moved or is not used in Qiskit anymore. In practice, the module was never meant to be used externally. | qiskit.test.mock | If absolutely necessary, consider copying the required code into your own test infrastructure. For fake backends, use `from qiskit_ibm_runtime.fake_provider import GenericBackendV2`. |
| 3 | from qiskit.test.reference_circuits import ReferenceCircuits | 7a1f | The `qiskit.test` module is deprecated. This module contains tooling and helpers for internal Qiskit testing, and most of its functionality had been moved or is not used in Qiskit anymore. In practice, the module was never meant to be used externally. | qiskit.test.reference_circuits | If absolutely necessary, consider copying the required code into your own test infrastructure. |
| 5 | qc = ReferenceCircuits.bell() | 7a1f | The `qiskit.test` module, which contains `ReferenceCircuits`, is deprecated. Functionality in this module was never meant to be used externally. | ReferenceCircuits.bell() | No direct refactoring provided by the document. Consider implementing the circuit directly or copying the necessary code if absolutely essential. |
| 6 | backend = FakeVigo() | fb0e | Fake backends designed for special testing purposes, such as `FakeVigo`, are deprecated as of Qiskit 0.46 and superseded by the new `GenericBackendV2` class. The `qiskit.providers.fake_provider` module has been migrated to the `qiskit-ibm-runtime` Python package. | FakeVigo | from qiskit_ibm_runtime.fake_provider import GenericBackendV2<br>backend = GenericBackendV2(num_qubits=5) |
