| 4 | `backend = FakeOpenPulse2Q()` | db0ee | Fake backends designed for special testing purposes have been superseded by the new GenericBackendV2 class. | `FakeOpenPulse2Q` | `from qiskit.providers.fake_provider import GenericBackendV2`\n`backend = GenericBackendV2(num_qubits=2)` |
| 7 | `with pulse.build() as pulse_prog:` | 51b49 | Running pulse jobs on backends from `qiskit.providers.fake_provider` is deprecated, and all support will be removed in Qiskit 1.0. For low-level Hamiltonian-simulation workloads, consider using a specialised library such as Qiskit Dynamics. | `pulse` jobs with `FakeOpenPulse2Q` backend | Consider using a specialised library such as Qiskit Dynamics. |
